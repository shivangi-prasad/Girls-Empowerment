                                With how accessible the internet is today, would you believe me if I told you the number of people who go online every day is still increasing?<br>
It is.<br> <strong>In fact, "constant" internet usage among adults increased by 5% in just the last three years.</strong><br>
Marketing has always been about connecting with audience in the right place and at the right time.  Digital marketing is any form of marketing that exists online.<br>
 Digital marketing refers to advertising delivered through digital channels such as search engines, websites, social media, email, and mobile apps.<br>
Using these online media channels, digital marketing is the method by which companies endorse goods, services, and brands.<br>
<strong>“Digital is at the core of everything in marketing today—it has gone from ‘one of the things marketing does’ to ‘THE thing that marketing does.’”</strong>

                                <h4>Components of digital marketing</h4>
Digital marketing spans across a massive network of digital touchpoints which we need to know.<br>
<ul>
<li><strong>Paid search</strong><br>Paid search, or pay-per-click (PPC) advertising, typically refers to the sponsored result on the top or side of a search engine results page (SERP). These ads charge you for every click and they can be tailored to appear when certain search terms are entered</li> 
<li><strong>Search engine optimization (SEO)</strong><br>SEO is the process of optimizing the content, technical setup, and reach of your website, so that your pages appear at the top of a search engine result for a specific set of keyword terms.</li>
<li><strong>Content marketing</strong><br>Effective content marketing is not outwardly promotional in nature, but rather serves to educate and inspire consumers who are seeking information.</li>
<li><strong>Social media marketing</strong><br>The key to effective social media marketing goes far beyond simply having active social media accounts.</li>
<li><strong>Email marketing</strong><br>E-mail is still the quickest and most direct way to reach customers. Email marketing should satisfy five core attributes. They must be trustworthy, relevant, conversational, coordinated across channels, and strategic.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile marketing</strong><br>Mobile devices are kept in our pockets, sit next to our beds, and are checked constantly throughout the day. SMS, MMS, and in-app marketing are all options to reach our customers on their devices, but beyond that, we must consider the coordination of our marketing efforts across other digital marketing channels.</li>
<li><strong>Marketing automation.</strong><br>Marketing automation is an integral platform that ties all of our digital marketing together</li>
</ul>
